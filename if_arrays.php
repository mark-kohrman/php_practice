#  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 20.
#     For example, [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3] becomes [2, 18, 12, 3].
// $numbers = [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3];
// $less_than = array();

// for ($i = 0; $i <= count($numbers); $i++) {
//   if ($numbers[$i] < 20) {
//     array_push($less_than, $numbers[$i]);
//   }
// }
// print_r($less_than);
// echo count($less_than);

#  2. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that start with the letter "w".
#     For example, ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"] becomes ["winner", "winner"].
$words = ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"];
$w_words = [];
$i = 0;

while ($i < count($words)) {
  if ($words[$i][0] == "w") {
    array_push($w_words, $words[$i]);
  }
  $i++;
}
// print_r($w_words);
#  3. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices greater than 5 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}].
// $items = [["name" => "chair", "price" => 100], ["name" => "pencil", "price" => 1], ["name" => "book", "price" => 4]];

// $i = 0;
// $expensive = [];

// while ($i <  count($items)) {
//   $item = $items[$i];
//   $item_price = $items[$i]["price"];
//   if ($item_price > 5) {
//     array_push($expensive, $item);
//   }
//   $i++;
// }
// print_r($expensive);
#  4. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the even numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [2, 4, 8].

#  5. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings shorter than 4 letters.
#     For example, ["a", "man", "a", "plan", "a", "canal", "panama"] becomes ["a", "man", "a", "a"].

#  6. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with names shorter than 6 letters (from the :name key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "book", price: 4}].

#  7. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 10.
#     For example, [8, 23, 0, 44, 1980, 3] becomes [8, 0, 3].

#  8. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that don't start with the letter "b".
#     For example, ["big", "little", "good", "bad"] becomes ["little", "good"].

#  9. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices less than 10 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}].

# 10. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the odd numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [5, 1, 9, 7].
